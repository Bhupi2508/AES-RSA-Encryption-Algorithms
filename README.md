# AES-RSA Encryption Algorithms

Node.js AES-RSA Encryption Algorithms: Secure data encryption and decryption using industry-standard cryptographic techniques. Code examples and utilities for seamless integration and enhanced data protection.

## Introduction

This project provides AES-RSA encryption algorithms implemented in Node.js. It includes both symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods. The project aims to demonstrate secure data encryption and decryption using industry-standard cryptographic techniques.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:
- Node.js (version 10 or above)

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

> git clone https://github.com/Bhupi2508/AES-RSA-Encryption-Algorithms.git

2. Install the dependencies:

> cd AES-RSA-Encryption-Algorithms
> npm install



## Running the Application

Start the server using the following command:

> npm start

### Usage
1. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000.
2. Enter the required input values (input1, input2, input3) and submit the form.
3. The result will be displayed on the page.

### Folder Structure
The folder structure of the project is as follows:

AES-RSA-Encryption-Algorithms/
  ├── Asymmetric AES/
  │   ├── Asymmetric.js
  │   └── generateKeys.js
  ├── Symmetric AES/
  │   └── Symmetric.js
  ├── public/
